Hello,

I am a retired computer programmer, and a forever-student.

I started a new open source project on github.com at the address https://github.com/ahmetax/akta.

In the project, I will try to collect copyright-free text materials for public use -especially for training Large Language Models- in Turkish.

Opensource LLM's are trained by mainly in English, and a few well known languages. Generally Turkish is not in that list.

Actually, there is no large and free Turkish text sources to be shared freely. I want to create such a source in Turkish.

Since you have the most-known free-to-use text source, I wanted to write you first.

May I translate your e-books into Turkish and put them in my project with your permission?

I will also write to universities, newspapers, publishers, etc for similar help.

If you permit, I can download your e-books and translate them into Turkish.

Is it possible?

Thanks in advance.

Ahmet Aksoy
