Kuzeydoğu Meksika'dan Yeni Bir Uzun Kulaklı Myotis (Myotis Evotis)

YAZAN

ROLLIN H. BAKER VE HOWARD J. STAINS

Kansas Üniversitesi'nden Meksika eyaletleri Coahuila, Nuevo Leon ve Tamaulipas'ta arazi ekipleri tarafından elde edilen uzun kulaklı yarasaların _Myotis evotis_ türüne ait olduğu, ancak adlandırılmış herhangi bir alt türe ait olmadığı
bulunmuştur. Bunlar şu şekilde adlandırılmış ve tanımlanmıştır:

#Myotis evotis auriculus# yeni alt tür

_Tür._--Dişi, yetişkin, deri ve kafatası; No. 55110, Univ. Kansas Mus.
Nat. Hist.; 10 mil. B ve 2 mil. G Piedra, 1200 ft., Sierra de Tamaulipas,
Tamaulipas; 9 Haziran 1953; Gerd H. Heinrich tarafından elde edilmiştir, orijinal numara
7061.

_Dağılım._--Orta Coahuila'dan güneye ve doğuya, orta Veracruz'a kadar kuzeydoğu Meksika'nın kıyı etekleri ve bitişik dağları.

_Tanı._--Orta boy (ölçümlere bakın), tür için kulaklar küçük; renk koyu, üst kısımlar (_j_14) Ochraceous-Tawny (renk terimleri
Ridgway, Renk Standartları ve Renk Adlandırması, Washington,
D. C., 1912'den alınmıştır), alt kısımlar Sıcak Sarımsı, kulaklar soluk; kafatası büyük, dişler büyük,
alt çene uzun.

_Karşılaştırma._--Colorado,
Wyoming ve Montana'dan _Myotis evotis evotis_ (H. Allen)'dan, _M. e. auriculus_ şu şekilde farklılık gösterir:
Ortalama olarak daha kısa kulaklar; renk daha koyu ve daha zengin; kulaklar daha soluk ve daha az kontrastlı, renk olarak, kürklü; kafatası, en az interorbital daralma hariç, alınan tüm ölçümlerde daha büyüktür; alın, yandan bakıldığında,
ön bölge daha şişkin olduğu için daha ani yükselir; dişler
daha
büyüktür.

_Açıklamalar._--_Myotis evotis auriculus_, _M. e. evotis_'ten dışarıdan daha büyük olmasa da, daha büyük bir kafatasına sahiptir ve yanal görünümde daha
ani bir şekilde yükselen bir alına sahiptir. _Auriculus_'un dişleri, özellikle ilk üst premolarları, _evotis_'inkilerden belirgin şekilde daha büyüktür.
İlk iki alt premolar _auriculus_'ta eşitken, _evotis_'te genellikle ilk alt premolar daha büyüktür. Mandibula, kafatasının en büyük uzunluğuna göre _auriculus_'ta daha uzundur (oran, 71-74) _evotis_'ten (oran, 67-71) daha uzundur.

Coahuilan örnekleri, _auriculus_ olarak sınıflandırılmış olsalar da, biraz daha soluktur (üst kısımlar (16) Ochraceous-Tawny; alt kısımlar (_e_) Açık Kahverengi)
ve Tamaulipas'taki yarasalara göre daha az ani yükselen alınlara sahiptir. Bu özelliklerde, Coahuilan hayvanları tipik _auriculus_ ve _evotis_ arasında bir yerdedir. Nuevo Leon'daki yarasa, hem renk hem de alın eğimi açısından, Coahuila'dakiler ile Tamaulipas'takiler arasında orta seviyededir.

Veracruz, Perote'den _Myotis evotis chrysonotus_ olarak tanımlanan bir yarasa
(J. A. Allen) [=_M. e. Miller ve Allen'ın (U. S. Nat. Mus.,
Bull. 144:118 ve 120-121, 25 Mayıs 1928) evotis_ adlı eseri burada _M. e.
auriculus_ olarak atanmıştır. Bu yazarlar tarafından yapılan ölçümler, bu yarasanın bu alt türün karakteristiği olan büyük bir kafatasına sahip olduğunu göstermektedir. Bu yazarlar tarafından ve Chihuahua'nın kuzeybatısındaki San Luis
Dağlarından benzer şekilde atanan bir başka örnek, _M. e. evotis_ gibi görünmektedir, ancak yayınlanan ölçümler (_loc. cit._) bu yarasanın kafatası ve çene boyutunun _auriculus_'a doğru eğilim gösterdiğini göstermektedir.

Tüm örnekler su üzerine gerilmiş sis ağlarında alınmıştır.
Coahuila'dan gelenler, karışık mesquite ve çalılıklardaki
alçak tepelerin tabanına yakın bir yerde bulunan beton bir su tankının üzerine yakalanmıştır. Nuevo Leon'da, Sierra Madre Oriental'daki dağlar arası bir vadide, etrafında bazı alçak ağaçların yetiştiği küçük bir göletin üzerine bir yarasa ağ ile vuruldu. Tamaulipas'ta iki yarasa, Sierra de Tamaulipas'ta dar, çalılıklarla çevrili bir dere yatağına gerilmiş bir sis ağına yakalandı. Yetişkin bir erkek yarasa 7,0 gram ağırlığındaydı;
7 yetişkin, gebe olmayan dişinin ortalama ve uç ağırlıkları 6,8'di
(5,2-8,0). 25 ve 26 Mart'ta alınan dişiler gebe değildi; 20 Haziran'da alınan bir tanesi emziriyordu. Saha çalışmalarının finansmanı için fonlar
Kansas Üniversitesi Vakıf Derneği ve
Ulusal Bilim Vakfı tarafından sağlandı.

_Ölçümler._--Holotipin ve tip lokalitesinden bir diğer dişinin (No. 55111 KU) ve Coahuila'dan 3 dişinin (No. 44726, 44729-30 KU) milimetre cinsinden ölçümleri sırasıyla şöyledir: toplam uzunluk, 94, 93, 97, 86, 96; kuyruk omurlarının uzunluğu, 43, 42, 41, 39, 45; arka ayağın uzunluğu, 9,5, 9, 10, 10, 8; çentikten kulağın yüksekliği, 20, 20, 20, 18, 20; ön kol uzunluğu, 37,9, 38,4, 40,2, 37,3, 38,5; kafatasının en büyük uzunluğu, 16.1, 16.4, 16.2, 15.8, 16.1; kondilobazal uzunluk, 15.4, 15.4,
15.6, 15.0, 15.4; zigomatik genişlik, 9.7, 9.9, 10.1, 9.4, 9.9; en az

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
