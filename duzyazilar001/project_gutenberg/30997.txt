Coahuila'dan Yeni Bir Yarasa (Cins Leptonycteris)

TARAFINDAN
HOWARD J. STAINS
Zooloji Bölümü, Güney Illinois Üniversitesi Yardımcı Doçenti

Meksika, Coahuila'da elde edilen memeli koleksiyonunda, 24 uzun burunlu yarasa, _Leptonycteris nivalis_, bulunmaktadır. Bu yarasaların, Coahuila'nın güneyinde bulunan bu türün diğer yarasalarına göre daha büyük bir kafatası ve daha uzun bir üçüncü parmağı vardır. Bu ayırt edici
karakterlere dayanarak, Coahuila'dan gelen bu uzun burunlu yarasaların yeni bir alt türe ait olduğunu kabul etmek uygun görünüyor, aşağıdaki gibi adlandırılmış ve tanımlanmıştır:

#Leptonycteris nivalis longala# yeni alt tür

_Tür._--Dişi, yetişkin, deri ve kafatası, No. 33087, Univ. Kansas
Mus. Nat. Hist.; 12 mil. G ve 2 mil. D Arteaga, 7500 ft., Coahuila;
11 Temmuz 1949; W. K. Clark tarafından elde edilmiştir, orijinal numarası 787'dir.

_Menzil._--Güney Coahuila'dan kuzeye, Teksas'ın Big Bend'ine (Brewster County)

_Tanı._--Büyük boy (ölçümlere bakın); üçüncü parmak uzunluğunda;
renk soluk, üst kısımlar Saç Kahverengi (büyük harfle yazılan renk terimleri Ridgway, Renk Standartları ve Renk Adlandırması, Washington,
D. C., 1912'den alınmıştır), alt kısımlar Duman Grisi; kafatası büyük ve geniştir.

_Karşılaştırmalar._--_Leptonycteris nivalis nivalis_'ten (Veracruz, Oaxaca,
Distrito Federal, Hidalgo, Jalisco ve
Sonora'dan örnekler), _L. n. longala_ şu şekilde farklılık gösterir: renk daha soluk, daha
beyazımsı ve daha az kahverengimsi; üçüncü parmak daha uzun (_longala_ 
Coahuila'dan ortalama 111,3 mm.; _nivalis_ Sonora'dan ortalama 91,0,
Jalisco'dan 96,4, Hidalgo'dan 98,0, Veracruz'dan 100,0,
Distrito Federal'den 100,2 ve Oaxaca'dan 98,6); kafatası daha büyük,
kafatası genişliği daha büyük (_longala_ 
Coahuila'dan ortalama 10,7 mm.; _nivalis_ Sonora'dan 9,8, Jalisco'dan 9,8, Hidalgo'dan 9,6,
Veracruz'dan 9,9, Distrito Federal'den 9,9 ve Oaxaca'dan 9,8);
mastoidal genişlik daha büyüktür (Coahuila'dan _longala_ ortalama 11,6
mm.; Sonora'dan _nivalis_ 10,5, Jalisco'dan 10,8, Hidalgo'dan 10,6, Veracruz'dan 10,9, Distrito Federal'den 10,8 ve Oaxaca'dan 10,7); kafatası daha yüksektir (Coahuila'dan _longala_ ortalama 10,0
mm.; Sonora'dan _nivalis_ 9,3, Jalisco'dan 9,2, Hidalgo'dan 9,2,
Veracruz'dan 9,3, Distrito Federal'den 9,3 ve Oaxaca'dan 9,1).
Yukarıda listelenen _longala_'nın her boyutunun ortalaması, _nivalis_'teki karşılık gelen
boyutun maksimumunu aşmaktadır.

_Açıklamalar._--_Leptonycteris nivalis longala_ Meksika Platosu'nun
kuzeydoğu ucunda yaşar. Teksas, Brewster County'den gelen yarasalar, _longala_ olarak adlandırılır, güney Coahuila'dan alınan örneklerden alınan tüm ölçümlerde ortalama biraz daha büyüktür.
Cerro Potosi, Municipio de Galeana, Nuevo Leon'dan gelen örnekler de üçüncü parmaklarının uzunluğuna göre _longala_ olarak adlandırılır. Teksas'tan gelen örnekler gibi, bu yarasalar da ortalama olarak Coahuila'dan gelen yarasalardan daha uzun ön kollara sahiptir.

Mount Orizaba'dan _L. n. nivalis_ topotipleri mevcut değildi,
ancak _nivalis_ alt türüne ait 111 örnek incelendi. Bu örnekler şu yerlerdendi: _Sonora_:
1/4 mil. W Aduana, 1600 ft., 4 örnek. _Jalisco_: Tamam. San
     Martin, 5000 ft., 18 mil. W Chapala, 3; 11 mil. W Chapala, 5000 ft.,
     1; 5 mil. W Chapala, 5000 ft., 58; 8 mil. NE Ocotlan, 5100 ft., 1.
     _Hidalgo_: 6 km. Kuzeybatı Tasquillo, 500 ft., 1. _Veracruz_: 3 km. W Boca
     del Rio, 25 ft., 22. _Distrito Federal_: Chicomostoc, Cerro Teutli,
     2-2/5 mil. NNW Milpa Alta, 2620 ft., 18. _Oaxaca_: Cuicatlan, 600
     ft., 1; 3 km. WNW Dominguillo, 730 ft., 2. Tüm bu örnekler
Kansas Üniversitesi Doğa Tarihi Müzesi'ndedir.
Bu _L. n. nivalis_ örneklerinde çok az fark edilebilir coğrafi varyasyon
bulunmuştur. Hiçbir örnek, kesin olarak,
sınıflandırılamaz _longala_ ve _nivalis_ arasındaki ara türler olarak, ancak ara türlerin batı San Luis Potosi'de veya Zacatecas'ta veya her iki eyalette de bulunacağı düşünülüyor. Dalquest (Meksika'nın San Luis Potosi Eyaleti Memelileri, Louisiana Eyalet Üniv. Çalışmaları,
Biyoloji . Seri No. 1, s. 27-28, 1953) Hda. Capulin, güneydoğu San Luis Potosi'den alınan beş numuneyi _L. n. nivalis_'e atıfta bulunur. Dalquest tarafından yapılan ölçümler _L. n.'nin diğer
ölçümleriyle uyumludur.nivalis_ yukarıda listelenmiştir.

_L. n. yerbabuenae_ Martinez ve Villa ismi, Guerrero eyaletindeki
Yerbabuena'dan alınan örneklere dayanıyordu. Bu ismin dayandığı
holotip dahil örnekler
yok edildi. Luis de la Torre (Fieldiana , 37:698, 1955) _yerbabuenae_'nin bir topotipini inceledi ve bu örneği Orizaba'dan _nivalis_'in bir topotipinden ayırt edemedi. Davis ve
Russell (Jour. Mamm., 33:236, 1952) _L. n. nivalis_ olarak tanımladılar
bir Morelos'tan yarasa, _yerbabuenae_ tipinin yaklaşık 32 mil kuzeydoğusundan alınmış, üçüncü parmağının Teksas'ın Big Bend'inden alınan örneklerden çok daha
kısa olduğunu belirtmiştir. _L.'yi yargılıyorum.
n. yerbabuenae_ _nivalis_ kelimesinin eşanlamlısı olarak kabul edilir, tıpkı de la Torre'nin yaptığı gibi.

Karşılaştırmalı materyal ödünç verdikleri için Teksas Tarım ve
Makine Koleji'nden Dr. W. B. Davis'e ve Chicago Doğa Tarihi Müzesi'nden Bay Colin C. Sanborn'a teşekkür ederiz. Ayrıca, saha çalışmalarına destek veren Kansas Üniversitesi Vakıf Derneği ve Ulusal Bilim Vakfı'na ve çalışmamda bana rehberlik eden Dr. Rollin H. Baker'a minnettarım.

_Ölçümler._--Aşağıdaki milimetre cinsinden ölçümler,
tipin ve tip ve 22 yetişkin topotipinin ortalama ve uç ölçümleri: toplam uzunluk, 79, 79 (73-86); arka ayak uzunluğu, 16, 16 (14-17); kulak uzunluğu, 16, 16,5 (15-17) ;
ön kol uzunluğu, 50.0, 50.6 (47.3-55.0); kafatasının en büyük uzunluğu, 28.1, 27.5 (26.1-29.0); zigomatik genişlik, 9.2, 9.6
(8.6-11.2); interorbital daralma, 4.6, 4.8 (4.1-5.4);
mastoidal genişlik, 11.7, 11.6 (11.0-12.1); beyin kasasının genişliği,
10.5, 10.7 (10.1-11.2); kafatasının en büyük yüksekliği, 9.8, 10.0
(9.6-10.5); maksiller diş sırasının alveolar uzunluğu, 8.9, 9.1
(8.5-9.6); ve üçüncü parmağın uzunluğu, 110.8, 111.3 (106.9-116.1).

_L. n. örnekleri. longala incelendi._--Toplam sayı, 109, aşağıdaki gibi: _Teksas_: mağaranın batı tarafı Emory Tepesi, Chisos Dağları, Brewster
Co., 7500 ft., 5 örnek (A ve M Teksas Koleji). _Coahuila_:
12 mil. S ve 2 mil. E Arteaga, 7500 ft., 24 (KU). _Nuevo Leon_:

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
