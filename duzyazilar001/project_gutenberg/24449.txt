Yaz yeryüzünde kraliçeyken
Sarayını yeşil bahçelerde kurdu
Yapraklardan oluşan goblenlerle asılmış,
Güneşin altın ipliklerini ördüğü
Zeminde damalı desenlerle
Tırpan kadife çimenlerin üzerinden geçer:
Sallanan yelpazeleri yumuşak rüzgarlar yayar
Kraliçe Yaz'ın başını serinletmek için her yöne:
Orman güvercini müziği yumuşatırdı,
Ve Eros lavtasına sık sık dokunurdu.

Yuvarlak Zaman'ın kadranı saatleri doldurdu,
Çiçek Maskesi'ne bürünerek

Şövalyeler ve güzel hanımlar gibi, hem kırmızı hem beyaz ipek giysiler içinde.

Ve etraflarındaki rüzgarlar eserken,
Ve çiçekleri sallayıp dağıtırken,

Aralarında fısıldanan bir söz şöyleydi
Zambak'ın Gül'ü nasıl hiçe saydığı,

Yaz'ın lütfuna talip olanlar sevgili,
Bütün yılın tacını kazanmak için--
Ve her cesur şampiyonun nasıl savaşacağı,
Kraliçe Yaz'ın doğruyu seçmesi için.

Sonra rüzgar kanatlı haberciler tiz bir sesle esti;
Listeler Yaz'ın görüşüne konuldu,

Armalı kalkanlar ve ladin flamalarıyla
Çalkanan bayrak ve fleur-de-luce:

Ve 'işlemeli neşeli perdelerle' yayıldı,
Her şey kavgaya hazır olana kadar.

Beyaz ve kırmızı bayrakları arasında,
Üstünde Gül ve Zambak,
Kraliçe Yaz yargıç koltuğuna oturdu,
Bütün çiçek kalabalığı onu selamladı.

Gümüş trompetin sesi
Altın dilleriyle, & yere
Parlayan şampiyonlar her biri bindi,
Parlak renklerini genişçe göstererek.

Önce parlayan Gül göründü,
Yeni çırpınan kızıl flamalarla;
Parıldayan dikenlerle, hepsi silahlı geldi,
Mızrak ve kalkanla--alev alev bir gül;
Çalkanan tepelik ve serbest örtüyle,
Ateşli bir at üzerinde,--görülmeye değer bir manzara!

Zambak şövalyesi uzun süre gecikmedi;
Beyaz giyinmiş gümüş zırhla,
Sahneye ışık gibi parladı,
Yeşil bahçenin ortasında bir lamba.
Atı süt beyazı, & yuvaları güzel
Orada parlayan gümüş zambaklarla.

Yaz rüzgarları başlangıcı esti:
Her şampiyon düz mızrakla uçtu,

Ve aşağıdaki çimenlerin üzerindeki
yaprakların ortasında çarpıştılar.

Hevesle bastırdı sonra bakan sıralar:
Bazıları bağırdı, "Zambak", bazıları, "Gül"
Ama savaşın kaderi asılıyken,
Yine gümüş trompetler şarkı söyledi;

Ve, her iki taraftan aniden hücum ederek,
Güller ve Zambakların
Hala mücadeleyi sürdürecek bir ordu
Güller için veya zambakların hayatı için

Gül, bakirelerin şövalyelerini tercih etti,
Flamalar her tonda kızardı
Gül zanaatı, çünkü yabani dikenlerden zayıf
Düzenleri büyüdü--karanlık ve soluktan
Bakire çiçeklerinden derin damasklara,
Ya da göğsünde saklı ateşi
tutan Gloire-de-Dijon,
Diğerleri gibi hala altın kalpli. Sabah bulutu gibi taşıyorlardı,
Ya da çimenli kıyıda pembe bir dalga,
Kırılan, gümüş püskürmeyi parçalayan
Thay-Thay-lances oynuyor;
Tepeli efsanelerde geldiler
Onlara karşı- kar ve yanan alev
Kızıl sel ile karışarak
Güllerin ve onların hoş kokulu kanlarının,

Çimlerin aşırı çoğaldığı,
Çiçek çekişmesi dalgalanıp yuvarlanırken,
Yeşilin üzerinde damalı talihle,
Sonunda Kraliçe ayağa kalkana kadar:

Ve zefir boynuzlarının esmesine neden oldu
Bir ateşkes, galibin tacının görünmesi için.
Ama yerde bir çelenk gibi
Güller ve zambaklar bulundu,
Öyle bağlı ve kilitlenmiş bir çekişme içinde yatıyorlardı
Her gümüş sap ve yapışan püskül,

Yiğit şampiyonlar yükselemediler
Kraliçenin önünde ödülünü almak için. Böylece savaş alanına doğru yürüdü

Gümüş ve altından yapılmış, zarif bir gül ve zambak tacıyla

Ve böylece Kraliçe Yaz düşüncelerini dile getirdi:

Ve her savaşçıya şöyle dedi:
Savaşınızın talihini okuyun
Birliğin tatlı uygun amblemi,
Ne Gül ne de Zambak yükseklerde ekilir,
Ama yan yana eşit hakla,
Ve Kırmızı ve Beyaz'ın hoş neşesi:

Erkekler ve kızlar görmekten memnun olsunlar,
Her zaman hoş bir arkadaşlıkta,

Yaşam ve Aşk birbirine sıkı sıkıya bağlı,
Ve zamanın kış havasına dayanacak kadar güçlü

Tutkunun kalbinde tüketilmeyen aşk
Ama altın alevli ve kararlı, tatlı:

Zamanın karları, saklansalar bile söndürülmeyecek:
Her bahar pembe gelgiti yeniler:

Her sevgili hanımının yüzünde
Zambakların zarafetiyle harmanlanmış gülleri görür:

Şair ve ressam över
Bu yaz günlerinin armasını;

Ve esen her bahçe tatlıdır
Zambakları Gülün yanına koyar.

Barış, o zaman tüm sınırlarımda olsun,
Gümüş zeytin ağacının altında."

Her gül, her zambak başı eğilmiş,
Ve her biri düşmüş düşmanını arıyordu:

Ve yaralılar dikkatli elleriyle,
Yeniden canlandırmak için balsam ve balla taşıyordu:

Ve çimleri biçtiler ve her koltuğu süslediler,
Ve hepsini dansçının ayaklarına uygun hale getirdiler;

Yazın dolunay altında,
Kızıl ve altın, hemen yükselen,
Ateşte kaynaşmış gül ve zambak gibi,
Gün batımının meşalesi sönmeden önce.

Sonra her şövalye zambak,
Kızgın, pembe bir hanımefendiyi,
Çok kırmızı;

Ne zambak elleri ne de kalpleri inkar etti
Gül renkli savaşçılar önce meydan okudu.

Dansın labirentinde hafif adımlarla,
Çabuk hareket ettiler kanatlı periler gibi;
Ölçülü müzik yumuşakça yükselirken,
Ve bosky vadisinden derin yankılanırken,
Ta ki, yapraklı orman tarafından,
Tatlı dilli bülbül cevapladı,
Gümüş ses akıntılarında erimiş,
Ay ışığında birleşmiş, kaybolmuş ve bulunmuş;
Dansçılar gibi, gölgede kalana kadar,
Yazın yemyeşil gecesinin solması.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
