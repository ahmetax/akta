Bu e-Kitap David Widger tarafından
Ocak 1992'de Derek Andrew'un metni ve Kasım 2002'de Bryan Taylor'ın çalışması yardımıyla üretilmiştir.

Kitap 31 Obadya

31:001:001 Obadya'nın vizyonu. Rab Tanrı Edom hakkında şöyle diyor: Rab'den bir söylenti duyduk ve uluslar arasında bir elçi
gönderildi, Kalkın ve ona karşı savaşta
ayaklanalım.

31:001:002 İşte, seni uluslar arasında küçük düşürdüm: çok
aşağılandın.

31:001:003 Yüreğinin gururu seni aldattı, kayanın yarıklarında oturan,
meskeni yüksek olan;
yüreğinde,
Kim beni yere indirecek? diyen.

31:001:004 Kendini kartal gibi yüceltsen de, yuvanı yıldızların arasına kursan da, oradan seni aşağı indireceğim, diyor RAB.

31:001:005 Hırsızlar sana gelse, geceleyin haydutlar (nasıl da
silindin!) yeteri kadar çalamazlar mıydı? Üzüm toplayıcılar sana gelse, biraz üzüm bırakmazlar mıydı?

31:001:006 Esav'ın işleri nasıl araştırılıyor! Gizli işleri nasıl
çıkarılıyor!

31:001:007 Seninle ittifak eden bütün adamlar seni sınıra kadar getirdiler: seninle barış içinde olan adamlar seni aldattılar ve sana karşı galip geldiler; ekmeğini yiyorlar, seni yaraladılar: onda anlayış yok.

31:001:008 O gün, diyor RAB, Edom'dan bilgeleri ve Esav'ın dağından anlayışlıları yok etmeyecek miyim?

31:001:009 Ve ey Teman, senin güçlü adamların dehşete düşecek,
Esav'ın dağından olanların hepsi katliamla yok edilecek.

31:001:010 Kardeşin Yakup'a karşı zorbalığın seni
örtecek ve sonsuza dek yok edileceksin.

31:001:011 Öteki tarafta durduğun gün,
Yabancıların ordularını esir alıp
sürdükleri,
Yabancılar kapılarından içeri girip
Kudüs'e kura çektikleri gün, sen de onlardan biriydin.

31:001:012 Fakat kardeşinin yabancı olduğu gün, onun gününe bakmamalıydın; Yahuda oğullarının yıkım
gününde onlara sevinmemeliydin; sıkıntı
gününde gururla konuşmamalıydın.

31:001:013 Felaket günlerinde halkımın kapısından içeri girmemeliydin; evet, felaket günlerinde onların sıkıntılarına bakmamalıydın, felaket günlerinde mallarına el koymamalıydın;

31:001:014 Kaçanları kesmek için kavşakta durmamalıydın; sıkıntı
gününde kalanları da teslim etmemeliydin.

31:001:015 Çünkü RAB'bin günü bütün ulusların üzerine yakındır: Sen ne yaptıysan sana da aynısı yapılacaktır: Senin mükafatın kendi başına dönecektir.

31:001:016 Çünkü sen kutsal dağımda içtiğin gibi, bütün uluslar da durmadan içecek, içecek ve yutacaklar ve hiç olmamış gibi olacaklar.

31:001:017 Fakat Sion dağında kurtuluş olacak ve kutsallık olacak; ve Yakup'un evi mallarını ele geçirecek.

31:001:018 Ve Yakup'un evi ateş olacak, ve Yusuf'un evi alev, ve Esav'ın evi anız olacak; ve onlar içlerinde tutuşup onları yiyecek; ve Esav'ın evinden geriye hiçbir şey kalmayacak; çünkü RAB söyledi. 31:001:019 Ve güneyliler Esav'ın dağını ele geçirecekler; ve ovadakiler Filistliler: ve Efraim'in tarlalarını ve Samiriye'nin tarlalarını ele geçirecekler: ve Benyamin
Gilead'ı ele geçirecek.

31:001:020 Ve İsrail oğullarının bu ordusunun sürgünü, Kenanlıların Sarefat'a kadar sürgününü ele geçirecek; ve Sefarad'da olan
Kudüs'ün sürgünü, güneyin
kentlerini ele geçirecek.

31:001:021 Ve kurtarıcılar Esav'ın dağını yargılamak için Siyon dağına çıkacaklar; ve krallık RAB'bin olacak.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
https://gutenberg.org or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made

ways.
