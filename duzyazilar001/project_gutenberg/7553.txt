QUOTES AND IMAGES FROM THE WORKS OF GILBERT PARKER




THE WORKS OF GILBERT PARKER




A human life he held to be a trifle in
the big sum of time

A heart-break for that kind is their
salvation

A man may be forgiven for a sin, but
the effect remains

A look too bright for joy, too intense
for despair

A sort of chuckle not entirely pleasant

A man you could bank on, and draw your
interest reg'lar

A left-handed boy is all right in the
world

A cloak of words to cover up the real
thought behind

Aboriginal in all of us, who must have
a sign for an emotion

Aboriginal dispersion

Adaptability was his greatest weapon in
life

Advantage to live where nothing was
required of her but truth

After which comes steady happiness or
the devil to pay (wedding)

Agony in thinking about the things
we're never going to do

Ah, let it be soon!  Ah, let him die
soon!

Air of certainty and universal
comprehension

All humour in him had a strain of the
sardonic

All genius is at once a blessing or a
curse

All the world's mad but thee and me

All men are worse than most women

All is fair where all is foul

All he has to do is to be vague, and
look prodigious (Scientist)

All are hurt some time

Always hoping the best from the worst
of us

Always calling to something, for
something outside ourselves

An inner sorrow is a consuming fire

And even envy praised her

Anger was the least injurious of all
grounds for separation

Answered, with the indifference of
despair

Antipathy of the lesser to the greater
nature

Antipathy of the man in the wrong to
the man in the right

As if our penalties were only paid by
ourselves!

At first--and at the last--he was kind

Ate some coffee-beans and drank some
cold water

Audience that patronisingly listens
outside a room or window

Awkward for your friends and gratifying
to your enemies

Babbling covers a lot of secrets

Bad turns good sometimes, when you know
the how

Begin to see how near good is to evil

Beginning of a lifetime of experience,
comedy, and tragedy

Being tired you can sleep, and in sleep
you can forget

Being generous with other people's
money

Being young, she exaggerated the
importance of the event

Being a man of very few ideas, he
cherished those he had

Beneath it all there was a little touch
of ridicule

Boldness without rashness, and hope
without vain thinking

But I don't think it is worth doing
twice

But to pay the vulgar penalty of
prison--ah!

But a wounded spirit who can bear

But the years go on, and friends have
an end

Came of a race who set great store by
mothers and grandmothers

Carrying with him the warm atmosphere
of a good woman's love

Cherish any alleviating lie

Clever men are trying

Cling to beliefs long after conviction
has been shattered

Confidence in a weak world gets
unearned profit often

Conquest not important enough to
satisfy ambition

Counsel of the overwise to go jolting
through the soul

Courage which awaits the worst the
world can do

Courage; without which, men are as the
standing straw

Credulity, easily transmutable into
superstition

Damnable propinquity

Dangerous man, as all enthusiasts are

Death is not the worst of evils

Death is a magnificent ally; it
untangles knots

Delicate revenge which hath its hour
with every man

Did not let him think that she was
giving up anything for him

Do what you feel you've got to do, and
never mind what happens

Does any human being know what he can
bear of temptation

Don't go at a fence till you're sure of
your seat

Don't be a bigger fool than there's any
need to be

Don't be too honest

Down in her heart, loves to be mastered

Duplicity, for which she might never
have to ask forgiveness

Each of us will prove himself a fool
given perfect opportunity

Egotism with which all are diseased

Egregious egotism of young love there
are only two identities

Engrossed more, it seemed, in the
malady than in the man

Enjoy his own generosity

Even bad company's better than no
company at all

Every true woman is a mother, though
she have no child

Every man should have laws of his own

Every shot that kills ricochets

Evil is half-accidental, half-natural

Face flushed with a sort of pleasurable
defiance

Fascinating colour which makes evil
appear to be good

Fear a woman are when she hates, and
when she loves

Fear of one's own wife is the worst
fear in the world

Flood came which sweeps away the rust
that gathers in the eyes

Follow me; if I retreat, kill me; if I
fall, avenge me

For a man having work to do, woman,
lovely woman, is rocks

Freedom is the first essential of the
artistic mind

Frenchman, volatile, moody, chivalrous,
unreasonable

Frenchman,  slave of ideas, the victim
of sentiment

Friendship means a giving and a getting

Futility of goodness, the futility of
all

Future of those who will not see,
because to see is to suffer

Good fathers think they have good
daughters

Good is often an occasion more than a
condition

Good thing for a man himself to be owed
kindness

Grove of pines to give a sense of
warmth in winter

Grow more intense, more convinced, more
thorough, as they talk

Had the luck together, all kinds and
all weathers

Had the slight flavour of the superior
and the paternal

Had got unreasonably old

Have not we all something to hide--with
or without shame?

Have you ever felt the hand of your own
child in yours

He had neither self-consciousness nor
fear

He admired, yet he wished to be admired

He hated irony in anyone else

He was not always sorry when his
teasing hurt

He felt things, he did not study them

He was in fact not a philosopher, but a
sentimentalist

He had only made of his wife an
incident in his life

He didn't always side with the majority

He does not love Pierre; but he does
not pretend to love him

He was strong enough to admit ignorance

He has wheeled his nuptial bed into the
street

He had had acquaintances, but never
friendships, and never loves

He had no instinct for vice in the name
of amusement

He left his fellow-citizens very much
alone

He never saw an insult unless he
intended to avenge it

He had tasted freedom; he was near to
license

He borrowed no trouble

He wishes to be rude to some one, and
is disappointed

He's a barber-shop philosopher

Heaven where wives without number
awaited him

Her sight was bounded by the little
field where she strayed

Her voice had the steadiness of despair

Her stronger soul ruled him without his
knowledge

Her own suffering always set her
laughing at herself

Highsterics, they call it

His courtesy was not on the same
expansive level as his vanity

His duties were many, or he made them
so

His gift for lying was inexpressible

Honesty was a thing he greatly
desired--in others

How little we can know to-day what we
shall feel tomorrow

How can one force one's heart?  No, no!
One has to wait

How many sons have ever added to their
father's fame?

How many conquests have been made in
the name of God

How can you judge the facts if you
don't know the feeling?

Hugging the chain of denial to his
bosom

Hunger for happiness is robbery

I love that love in which I married him

I was never good at catechism

I said I was not falling in love--I am
in love

I am only myself when I am drunk

I have a good memory for forgetting

I don't wish to fit in; things must fit
me

I like when I like, and I like a lot
when I like

I always did what was wrong, and liked
it--nearly always

I should remember to forget it

I don't believe in walking just for the
sake of walking

I don't think. Bunu bilmek için yeterince yaşlıyım

Bana olan nezaketin için sana ödeme yapamam ve yapmak da istemiyorum

Onu dinlemek zorundaydım ve o da bana
dinlemek için ödeme yapmak zorundaydı

Ben küstah olarak doğdum

Ben--buna engel olamadım

İyi bir düşüncen varsa, onu uygula

Biri hatırlıyorsa, diğeri neden
unutsun

Kadınların hafızası olmasaydı, diye cevapladı,
fazla bir şeyleri olmazdı

Eğer beceriksiz insan parmakları buna karışmasaydı

Aldatıcı umutlar ve sorumsuz
aldatmacalar

Hayal gücü, aşk diye geçen birçok şeyin
kökenidir

İhtiyatlı bir şekilde
sabırsızlık onun
sloganıydı

Bütün sırlarda bir tür suçluluk vardır

Yüreğinde asla bir erkek gibi
dünyaya meydan okuyamaz

Kendi önemsizliğine
kızmaya meyillidir

Doğruluğu tespit etme içgüdüsü, her ikisinde de
uygulanmıştır taraflar

Mesleği olan ve bunu anlamayan insanlara müdahale edin

İrlandalıların sadece iki şeye yetenekleri vardır
--kelimeler ve kadınlar

İyi yaşama alışkanlığı sadece alışkanlık mıdır
ve sadece hareket etmek midir

Korkaklara karşı nazik olmak zordur

Hapishaneleri dolduran Adalet değil,
Yasadır

Öldüren kırık kalp değil,
kırık gururdur

Yaşamak güzeldir, değil mi?

Boş durmak zordur ve ayrıca önemlidir

Öldürmek veya ölmek çok da önemli değildir--oyunda
olan
şeydir

Ne yaptıkları değil, ne yapmadıklarıdır

Ne olacağımızı söylemek bize düşmez, her zaman değil

Zevklerimiz
sönükleştiğinde pişman olmak kolaydır

Asla zeki
olmayanlar

Sadece gitmek işe yaramaz--bir yere
gitmek
zorundasın

Her yerde Yahudiler Çinliden
daha kötü muamele

Hasta kalbi rahatlatan bir itiraf

İtiraf odasının sevinci

Onu iki kez yanağından öptü--on beş yıldır ilk kez

Sessizlik yalanının konuşma yalanı kadar
kötü olduğunu biliyordu

Gözlerini ne zaman kapatması ve ne zaman
açık tutması gerektiğini biliyordu

Ne kadar kötü olduğunu biliyordu ve aldırmıyordu

Yüzünün asla
yüzünden dönmeyeceğini biliyordu ben

Denge çarkı yok. Beyni var,
ama yeterli değil

Hukuk. It is expensive whether you win
or lose

Learned what fools we mortals be

Learned, as we all must learn, that we
live our dark hour alone

Let others ride to glory, I'll shoe
their horses for the gallop

Liars all men may be, but that's wid
wimmin or landlords

Life is only futile to the futile

Lighted candles in hollowed pumpkins

Likenesses between the perfectly human
and the perfectly animal

Lilt of existence lulling to sleep
wisdom and tried experience

Liquor makes me human

Live and let live is doing good

Lonely we come into the world, and
lonely we go out of it

Longed to touch, oftener than they did,
the hands of children

Lose their heads, and be so absurdly
earnest

Love can outlive slander

Love, too, is a game, and needs playing

Love knows not distance; it hath no
continent

Love has nothing  to do with ugliness
or beauty, or fortune

Lyrical in his enthusiasms

Man who tells the story in a new way,
that is genius

Man grows old only by what he suffers,
and what he forgives

Man or woman must not expect too much
out of life

May be more beautiful in uncertain
England than anywhere else

Meditation is the enemy of action

Memory is man's greatest friend and
worst enemy

Men and women are unwittingly their own
executioners

Men feel surer of women than women feel
of men

Men do not steal up here: that is the
unpardonable crime

Men must have their bad hours alone

Men are like dogs--they worship him who
beats them

Men are shy with each other where their
emotions are in play

Miseries of this world are caused by
forcing issues

Missed being a genius by an inch

Monotonously intelligent

More idle than wicked

Most honest thing I ever heard, but
it's not the most truthful

Most important lessons of life--never
to quarrel with a woman

Mothers always forgive

My excuses were making bad infernally
worse

Mystery is dear to a woman's heart

Nature twists in back, or  anywhere,
gets a twist in's brain too

Nervous legs at a gallop

Never believed that when man or woman
said no that no was meant

Never looked to get an immense amount
of happiness out of life

Never to be content with superficial
reasons and the obvious

Never give up your soul to things only,
keep it for people

No note of praise could be pitched too
high for Elizabeth

No, I'm not good--I'm only beautiful

No news--no trouble

No virtue in not falling, when you're
not tempted

No past that is hidden has ever been a
happy past

No man so simply sincere, or so
extraordinarily prejudiced

Noise is not battle

Not good to have one thing in the head
all the time

Not content to do even the smallest
thing ill

Not to show surprise at anything

Nothing so good as courage, nothing so
base as the shifting eye

Nothing is futile that is right

Nothing so popular for the moment as
the fall of a favourite

Of those who hypnotize themselves, who
glow with self-creation

Of course I've hated, or I wouldn't be
worth a button

Often called an invention of the devil
(Violin)

Often, we would rather be hurt than
hurt

One does the work and another gets paid

One always buys back the past at a
tremendous price

One doesn't choose to worry

One favour is always the promise of
another

Only the supremely wise or the deeply
ignorant who never alter

Oriental would think not less of him
for dissimulation

Paradoxes which make for laughter--and
for tears

Passion to forget themselves

Pathetically  in earnest

People who are clever never think of
trying to be

Philosophers are often stupid in human
affairs

Philosophy which could separate the
petty from the prodigious

Political virtue goes unrewarded

Prepared for a kiss this hour and a
reproach the next

Preserved a marked unconsciousness

Protest that it is right when it knows
that it is wrong

Put the matter on your own hearthstone

Queer that things which hurt most can't
be punished by law

Rack of secrecy, the cruelest
inquisition of life

Reading a lot and forgetting everything

Reconciling the preacher and the
sinner, as many another has

Religion to him was a dull recreation
invented chiefly for women

Remember the sorrow of thine own wife

Remember your own sins before you
charge others

Rewarded for its mistakes

Romance is an incident to a man

Sacrifice to the god of the pin-hole

Sardonic pleasure in the miseries of
the world

Saw how futile was much competition

Saying uncomfortable things in a
deferential way

Scoundrel, too weak to face the
consequences of his sin

Secret of life: to keep your own
commandments

Self-will, self-pride, and
self-righteousness were big in him

She lacked sense a little and
sensitiveness much

She was not to be forced to answer his
arguments directly

She knew what to say and what to leave
unsaid

She was beginning to understand that
evil is not absolute

She valued what others found useless

She wasn't young, but she seemed so

She had not suffered that sickness,
social artifice

She had provoked love, but had never
given it

She had never stooped to conquer

Should not make our own personal
experience a law unto the world

Shure, if we could always be 'about the
same,' we'd do

Simply to have death renewed every
morning

Slander ever scorches where it touches

Slow-footed hours wandered by, leaving
apathy in their train

Smiling was part of his equipment

So say your prayers, believe all you
can, don't ask questions

Solitude fixes our hearts immovably on
things

Some people are rough with the
poor--and proud

Some wise men are fools, one way or
another

Some are hurt in one way and some in
another

Sometimes the longest way round is the
shortest way home

Soul tortured through different degrees
of misunderstanding

Spurting out little geysers of other
people's cheap wisdom

Still the end of your existence, I
rejoined--to be amused?

Strike first and heal after--"a kick
and a lick"

Struggle of conscience and expediency

Surely she might weep a little for
herself

Suspicion, the bane of sick old age

Sympathy, with curiousness in their
eyes and as much inhumanity

Sympathy and consolation might be much
misplaced

Thanked him in her heart for the things
he had left unsaid

That anxious civility which beauty can
inspire

That iceberg which most mourners carry
in their breasts

That he will find the room empty where
I am not

The Government cherish the Injin much
in these days

The Injin speaks the truth,
perhaps--eye of red man multiplies

The blind tyranny of the just

The soul of goodness in things evil

The higher we go the faster we live

The gods made last to humble the pride
of men--there was rum

The world never welcomes its deserters

The furious music of death and war was
over

The tender care of a woman--than many
pharmacopoeias

The beginning of the end of things was
come for him

The ravings of a sick man are not
always counted ravings

The friendship of man is like the shade
of the acacia

The sea is a great breeder of
friendship

The vague pain of suffered indifference

The soul is a great traveller

The happy scene of the play before the
villain comes in

The threshold of an acknowledged love

The Barracks of the Free

The real business of life is trying to
understand each other

The world is not so bad as is claimed
for it

The temerity and nonchalance of despair

There is nothing so tragic as the
formal

There are things we repent of which
cannot be repaired

There is something humiliating in even
an undeserved injury

There should be written the one word,
"Wait"

There is no refuge from memory and
remorse in this world

There was never a grey wind but there's
a greyer

There is no influence like the
influence of habit

There is no habit so powerful as the
habit of care of others

There's no credit in not doing what you
don't want to do

These little pieces of art make life
possible

They think that if a vote's worth
having it's worth paying for

They whose tragedy lies in the capacity
to suffer greatly

Things in life git stronger than we are

Things that once charmed charm less

Think with the minds of twelve men, and
the heart of one woman

Think that a woman gives the heart for
pleasant weather only?

Think of our position

Thou wouldst not think how ill all's
here about my heart

Time when she should and when she
should not be wooed

Time is the test, and Time will have
its way with me

Time a woman most yearns for a man is
when she has refused him

To die without whining

To be popular is not necessarily to be
contemptible

To sorrow may their humour be a foil

To-morrow is no man's gift

Touch of the fantastic, of the
barbaric, in all genius

Training in the charms of
superficiality

Tricks played by Fact to discredit the
imagination

Triumph of Oriental duplicity over
Western civilisation

Truth waits long, but whips hard

Tyranny of the little man, given a
power

Undisciplined generosity

Untamed by the normal restraints of a
happy married life

Uses up your misery and makes you tired
(Work)

Vanity is the bane of mankind

Vanity of successful labour

Vanity; and from this much feminine
hatred springs

Very severe on those who do not pretend
to be good

Visions of the artistic
temperament--delight and curse

War is cruelty, and none can make it
gentle

Was not civilisation a mistake

We don't live in months and years, but
just in minutes

We want to get more out of life than
there really is in it

We want every land to do as we do; and
we want to make 'em do it

We grow away from people against our
will

We are only children till we begin to
make our dreams our life

We care so little for real justice

We do what we forbid ourselves to do

We suffer the shames we damn in others

We must live our dark hours alone

We speak with the straight tongue; it
is cowards who lie

We'll lave the past behind us

What fools there are in the world

What is gone is gone. Mezarlar
putperestliktir

Bir ülkede suç olan şey, bir diğerinde erdemdir

Ne kadar da hoş bir kalabalıksınız
-toptancı çöpçüler

Yüz yıl sonra ne olacak

Ne olmuşsa bir rüyaydı; şimdi ne varsa
gerçektir

Bir çocuk doğduğunda anne de
yeniden
doğar

Kampınızı vurduğunuzda, ateşleri
söndürdüğünüzde

Tanrı izin verdiğinde, insan umutsuzluğa kapılır mı?

Bir adam güneşte gülüp
kötülük hakkında hiçbir şey
düşünmediğinde

Işığın karanlık olduğu yerde

Toplumun sesini asla
duymayacağım yerde Sen

Kim bilir!

Bir kadını kim anlayabilir?

Kim sefaletten
hastalıklı bir zevk alır

Kim New York'ta 'Tanrı seni korusun' der!
'Kahretsin!' derler

Özbilinci hiç bilmeyen

Zeka her zaman yoksulluğun dirseğindedir

Para olmadan beyinler nadiren tek başına kazanır

Kadının en derin hakkı, neşesi ve acısı
bir arada--teselli

Kadınlar yalnızca kocalarının
arabuluculuğuyla Cennete kabul edilir

Kadınlar yarı aziz, yarı aptaldır

Kadınlar sizi parlak günlerde terk edebilir

Kadınlar kanıtlara göre değil,
duygularına göre hareket eder

Hasta bir kişi için dünya sadece dört duvardan ibaretti

Bu kadar uzun yaşamaya ve
bu kadar çok şey görmeye değer

Geriye dönüp çocukluğunu
hatırlamazdı

Kuzeye doğru cennete ve güneye doğru cehenneme
gittin

Hayallerini kaybettin

Asla bir
gazete yalanını
gerçekten geçemezsin

Hayatın ölçüsü olarak zamanı alamazsın

O küstahlığın kefaretini ödeyecek kadar uzun
yaşayamazsın

Bıçağı alana kadar
akşam yemeği diye bağırmazsın somunda

Bir skandalı gizlemeye çalışarak asla daha az
azaltamazsın

Kör bir pervasızlığın var ve bu yüzden
kendini cesur sanıyorsun

Hazır olmalısın, hepsi bu

Sen--hepiniz şüphelenmeye çok hazırdınız

Gençlik kibirlere aç

Gençlik, gençliğin tek yoldaşıdır

Gençlik bir rüyadır, orta yaş bir sanrı,
yaşlılık bir hata

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
