Wyoming ve Colorado'dan Yeni Bir Cep Gopher'ı (Thomomys Cinsi)

E. RAYMOND HALL

Wyoming'den, Kansas Üniversitesi Doğa Tarihi Müzesi'nde biriktirilen küçük memeliler arasında, yaygın
tür _Thomomys talpoides_ örnekleri bol miktarda temsil edilmektedir. Bunların çoğu için alt tür
adları mevcuttur, ancak Wyoming ve Colorado'daki Sierra
Madre Sıradağları'ndan gelen örnekler, karşılaştırma yapıldığında, daha önce isimlendirilmemiş bir alt türe ait olduğu kanıtlanmıştır ve bu alt tür şu şekilde tanımlanabilir ve adlandırılabilir:

#Thomomys talpoides meritus# yeni alt tür

_Tür._--Erkek, yetişkin, kafatası ve deri, no. 25628 Mus. Nat. Hist.
Univ. Kansas; 8 mil. K ve 19-1/2 mil. D Savery, 8800 ft.,
Carbon County, Wyoming; 19 Temmuz 1948'de George M. Newton tarafından elde edildi; orijinal no. 4.

_Range._--Güney Wyoming ve
Kuzey Colorado'daki Sierra Madre Sıradağları.

_Diagnosis._--Boyut küçük (ölçümlere bakın); renk koyu,
Temmuz ayının yıpranmış kürkündeki üst kısımlar (yakın, _n_) Raw'dan daha koyu
Umber (büyük harfle yazılan terimler Ridgway, Renk Standartları ve
Renk Adlandırması, Washington, D. C., 1912) ve Ağustos ayının taze kürkünde (yakın, 16') Prout's Brown ve Mummy Brown arasında;
kafatası küçük; baziler uzunluğa göre, kafatası dar
rostrum, zigomata ve mastoidler; burunlar kısa ve arkada kesik; burunların arkasında uzanan ön maksiller; temporal çizgiler arkada belirsiz ve ayrıktır.

_Karşılaştırmalar._-- _Thomomys talpoides rostralis_'ten (Kuzey Platte Nehri Vadisi, Saratoga'nın SW'si, Wyoming), doğu ve güneydeki alt türler, _T. t. meritus_ şunlarda farklılık gösterir: Daha küçük boyut,
daha koyu renk, daha küçük ve daha ince kafatası. İncelik, özellikle zigomata,
mastoidler ve kürsü boyunca genişlikte belirgindir. _Thomomys talpoides clusius_'tan (topotipler), kuzey ve batıdaki alt türler, _T. t.
meritus_ şunlarda farklılık gösterir: Renk çok daha koyu; kürsü daha uzun; kafatası
mastoidler ve zigomata boyunca daha dar; timpanik ve ayrıca
mastoid, büller daha küçüktür. _T. t. clusius_ ile benzerlik

kafatası interorbital darlığında ve
diş sırasının kısalığında gösterilmiştir.

_Açıklamalar._--_T. t. meritus_ isminin dayandığı Wyoming'den _Thomomys_ örnekleri Bay E. Lendell Cockrum ve
ortakları tarafından elde edilmiştir ve doğuda _T. t. rostralis_ ile batıda _T. t. clusius_ arasında geçiş gösterilebileceği düşünülmüştür.
Hayvanlar bunun yerine,
küçük boyut, koyu renk ve kafatasının inceliği bakımından
her iki alt türden de farklı olan bir alt tür olduğunu göstermiştir. Saha çalışmasındaki yardım için Kansas Üniversitesi Vakıf Derneği'ne teşekkür ederiz.

_Ölçümler._--Tip lokalitesinden yedi yetişkin erkek ve beş yetişkin dişinin ortalama ve uç ölçümleri şu şekildedir: Toplam uzunluk, [Erkek] 204 (193-226), [Dişi] 207
(193-210); kuyruk uzunluğu, 56 (46-68), 56 (50-63); arka ayak uzunluğu, 27,6 (26-30), 27,4 (27-28); baziler uzunluk,
30,7 (29,0-33,0), 30,1 (29,5-30,7); zigomatik genişlik, 20,4
(18,9-21,6), 19,5 (18,8-20,0); en az interorbital genişlik, 6.2
(5.8-6.6), 6.1 (5.9-6.3); mastoidal genişlik, 17.9 (16.9-18.5),
17.2 (16.7-17.6); burunların uzunluğu, 13.7 (12.4-14.7), 13.2
(12.8-13.9); kürsü genişliği, 7.0 (6.5-7.5), 6.9 (6.7-7.3);
kürsü uzunluğu, 16.3 (15.3-17.5), 15.8 (15.3-16.1); alveolar
maksiller diş sırasının uzunluğu, 7.1 (6.9-7.3), 7.1 (6.8-7.5).

_İncelenen örnekler._--Toplam sayı 26 ve aksi belirtilmediği takdirde

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
