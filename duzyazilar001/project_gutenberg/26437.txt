HUFFY BİR KOCANIN RUBAIYATI

Ben

Uyanıyorum, Güneş Uçup Gidiyor
Her Gece Mutluluk Rüyaları Görüyorum,
Ey mübarek Rüyalar--Ev Mutluluğuyla Dolu,
Ne yazık ki çok erken! Işıkla birlikte sürgün edildiler.

II

En kısa şekilde anlatacağım
Tüm sıkıntılarımın sebebini--eğer izin verirseniz--
O zaman herkes nedenini bilecektir
Benim tavrım ciddidir ve ben eşcinsel değilim.

III

Noel günü iyi bir arkadaş
Eşime bir kitap hediye etti; şüphesiz en iyi niyetle.
"Ömer Hayyam'ın Rubaileri" idi.
Onun gelişinin acısını az hayal ettim.

IV

Tatil telaşı bittikten sonra,
Ve her şey bir kez daha yerli yerine oturduktan sonra,
Eşim o kitapta eğlenmek için zaman buldu,
Ve bana onun kadim bilgisini ne kadar sevdiğini anlattı.

V

Kısa sürede korkunç Ömer çılgınlığına kapıldı,
Öğrendiğim kadarıyla diğer kocalar bunu kötü buluyor.
Ama artık geçmişte kalan diğer çılgınlıkların aksine,
Bu beni çok delirtecek güce sahip.

VI

Yıllar önce bıktığı diğerleri,--
Vazolar, yelpazeler ve kaşıklar toplamak,--
Evimizin konforunu etkilemiyordu,
Bu yüzden üzülmek için hiçbir sebep yoktu.

VII

Ama şimdi eve her döndüğümde
Eski sevgili Eşimin,
Ömer'in Rubaiyat'ına o kadar dalmış olduğunu görüyorum,
Hemen okumaya devam ediyor ve neredeyse hiç uyanmıyor.

VIII

Ya da onu elinde kalemle buluyorum,
Belki de muhteşem olan dörtlükleri öğütürken,
Beni dinlemeye çalışıyor: Emin olun
Ben böyle bir emre uymuyorum.

IX

Kaderimin ne olacağını bilseydim,
Anahtarını tuttuğum bir çekmecenin içinde,
O kitap sonsuza dek kaybolurdu
Ve böylece bana biraz huzur kazandırırdı.

X

Ama ah, Kaderin İronisi--işte böyle
"Dalın Altındaki Şiirler Kitabı"
Sabah'tan Çiyli Akşam'a kadar duyduğum şey bu.
Bir Vahşi Doğa _Cennet_ti Şu Anda.

XI

Bazen çok yorgun olduğumda ve Eğlenmek için
Yalvardığımda, Karım "Okuyacağım" der.
Ve bana duyurmaya çalıştığı şey şu,
"Dünya'nın ilk Kili ile Son İnsanı yoğurdular."

XII

Ama Zekâya Sahipken,
Onayladığımı ve bu nedenle Sakince oturduğumu hayal etme.
Şapkamı alıp Evden aceleyle çıkarım,
Ve o bitirene kadar geri dönmem.

XIII

Dua edebilirdim ve muhtemelen
Gökyüzünün Bir Yerinden rahatlayabilirdim.
Ama Karım, Ömer'in hesabının bunu kanıtladığını söyler
"Sen veya Ben kadar Güçsüzce hareket ediyor."

XIV

En azından sunduğu doktrin bu,
Her ne kadar bana anlamsız gelse de.
Söylediklerine inanmamam
Karımın ona olan sevgisini daha da yoğun hale getiriyor. XV

Ve böylece--Rubaiyat onun İnancıdır.
Her türlü İhtiyaçta Onun Rahatlığıdır.
Saçımı yolarım--fırtınaya tutarım--yemin ederim, ve yine de,
O sadece sevgili Ömer'e kulak verir.

XVI

"Bazıları bu dünyanın ihtişamı için; ve bazıları Peygamberin gelecek Cenneti için iç çeker;"
İstediğim en büyük nimet,
Bu davetsiz misafirin yerini bir arkadaş olarak alabilmemdir.

XVII

Şimdi evli olduğumuz tüm yıllar boyunca,
Şeytan kıskançlığı bir kez bile içeri sızmamıştı
Ta ki bu Ömer--sekiz yüz yıl önce ölmüştü,
Gelip de benden sevgisini kazanana kadar.

XVIII

Bu geç tarihte,
Çok uzun zaman önce ölmüş bir adamın
Sadece benim olan sevgi dolu bağlılığı yabancılaştırabileceğini düşünmek beni üzüyor.
Böyle bir kadere karşı haykırmam şaşırtıcı değil.

XIX

"Dünyasal Umut, insanların kalplerini
Külleri döndürür--ya da gelişir; ve anon,"
Tıpkı uzun zaman önceki o mutlu Günler
Benimdi, o zamanlar tatlı bir Zaman dilimi için.

XX

Son birkaç Aydır hevesle
Kulüplerime gidiyorum; orada Karılar ve onları nasıl idare edeceğim konusunda
büyük Tartışmalar duyuyorum.
Ama içeri girdiğimden daha akıllıca gelmiyor.

XXI

Garip, değil mi? Benden önce bu Sorun Kapısından geçen tüm
Kocalardan Hiçbiri iyi bir Tavsiye sözü bırakmadı,
Ne de en iyisinin ne olduğunu önerdi.

XXII

Arkadaşlarım bana yardım edemiyor, yine de
Benim üzgün bakışlarıma ve Yas tutma şeklime alaycı bir şekilde gülüyorlar.
Ruhumun Acısını bilmiyorlar,
Karısından yoksun--mutsuz--ve perişan.

XXIII

Ama şunu biliyorum, tek Gerçek Işık
Sevgiyi Yaksın ya da öfke beni tamamen tüketsin,
Eski Mutluluğumu,
Tüm büyük Dünyaya sahip olmaktansa, tercih ederim.

XXIV

Eşime nereye varacağımı göstermeye sık sık çalışırım.
Kitabını alır ve Dikkat etmem gerektiğini söyler
"Yaratılışın ilk sabahı
Hesaplaşmanın son Şafağının Okuyacağı Şeyi yazmıştır."

XXV

Bir gün ona şunu sormak istedim
Bu çılgınlığın ne kadar, ne kadar sürmesi bekleniyor? Gülümsedi ve dedi ki, "Canım, 'Yarın Doğmamış ve Dün Ölmüş' diye endişelenme."

XXVI

"'Hareket Eden Parmak yazar ve Yazmış

Devam eder.'" "Ve kesinlikle canım, Kaderin

Eline boyun eğecek cesaretin var,
Kendine tek bir zerre yardım edemediğinde."

XXVII

ÖNCEDEN BELİRLENMİŞ--İnançsızlıkla dolu--
Kabul etmeli miyim, Rahatlama yok mu?
Bunun düşüncesi bile beni en çok delirtiyor,
Ve beni Kederle Dünya'ya doğru eğiyor.

XXVIII

Ah, keşke bir şekilde Komplo
"Şeylerin üzücü Planını bütünüyle kavramak için";
Ne kadar çabuk onu parçalara ayırırdım--ve sonra

Yüreğimin arzusuna daha yakın bir şekilde yeniden şekillendirirdim.

XXIX

Ya da, çok geç olmadan bir Kanatlı Melek
"Henüz açılmamış Kader Rulosunu durdurur"
Ve sert Kaydedici'nin dizeleri değiştirmesini sağlar,
Ve böylece hemen Eşimi bana geri verir.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
