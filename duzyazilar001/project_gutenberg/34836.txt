Doğu Colorado'dan Yeni Bir Cep Gopher (Thomomys Cinsi)

Yazan

E. RAYMOND HALL

Doğu-orta Colorado'daki _Thomomys talpoides_ türündeki cep gopher'ları uzun zamandır _Thomomys talpoides
clusius_ Coues alt türü olarak anılır ve tip lokalitesi Bridger Pass, Wyoming'dedir. Son zamanlarda,
iki alt tür, _T. t. attenuatus_ ve _T. t. rostralis_ (bkz. Hall ve Montague, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5(3):25-32, 28 Şubat 1951) Wyoming-Colorado sınırından isimlendirilmiştir ve bunun sonucunda doğu-orta Colorado'daki _Thomomys talpoides_ popülasyonları, yakın zamanda isimlendirilen _T. t. attenuatus_ ve _T. t.
rostralis_'e atfedilen coğrafi aralıklarla Wyoming'deki _T. t. clusius_'tan ayrılmıştır. Dolayısıyla doğu-orta Colorado'daki hayvanların alt tür kimliği şüphelidir. İlgili materyallerin incelenmesi, _Thomomys talpoides macrotis_ F.
W. Miller (Proc. Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:41, 14 Aralık 1930) ve _Thomomys talpoides cheyennensis_ Swenk (Missouri Valley Fauna, 4:5, 1 Mart 1941) adlarının, kimlikleri şüpheli olan örneklere uygulanacağı beklentisiyle yapıldı. Bunun yerine, aşağıda daha ayrıntılı olarak belirtildiği gibi, bu inceleme, hemen yukarıda belirtilen iki adın da uygulanmadığını ortaya koymaktadır; Söz konusu Colorado örnekleri, şu ana kadar tanınmayan bir alt türe atıf yapmaktadır ve şu şekilde adlandırılıp tanımlanabilir:

#Thomomys talpoides retrorsus# yeni alt tür

_Thomomys clusius_, Warren, The Mammals of Colorado,
G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, s. 80, 1910;
Cary, N. Amer. Fauna, 33:132, 17 Ağustos 1911.

_Thomomys talpoides clusius_, Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna,
39:100, 15 Kasım 1915; F. W. Miller, Proc.
Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:41, 14 Aralık 1930;
Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, Univ. Oklahoma
Press, Norman, s. 162, 1942.

_Tür._--Erkek, yarı yetişkin, kafatası ve deri, No. 69840 Biyolojik
Surveys Koleksiyonu, ABD Nat. Hist.; Flagler, Kit Carson
County, Colorado'dan; 26 Kasım 1894'te Clark P.
Streator tarafından elde edildi; orijinal No. 4460.

_Menzil._--Colorado'daki Arkansas Divide'ın batı ucu
Seibert'in sekiz mil güneyinden batıya doğru Colorado Springs'e

_Tanı. _--Boyut orta (ölçümlere bakın); üst kısımlar
grimsi kahverengi; alt kısımlar daha açık; kafatası küçük; timpanik bullalar
orta derecede şişkin ve anterolateral olarak açılı; interpterygoid
boşluk dar U şeklinde; pterygoid hamuli transvers
genişleme olmadan; burun delikleri posterior olarak kesik; premaksiller diller
burun delikleri arkasından sekiz onda bir (0,5-1,1) milimetrelik mesafe boyunca posterior olarak çıkıntı yapar.

_Karşılaştırmalar._--Daha batıda bulunan _T. t. fossor_ ve _T. t.
rostralis_ ile karşılaştırıldığında, _T. t. retrorsus_'un seçilmiş farklılıkları şunlardır: daha açık renk; daha büyük kafatası; daha
şişkin timpanik bullalar; üst kesici dişler, rostrum ve zigomata boyunca (kafatasının uzunluğuna göre)
daha fazla genişlik. Renk
farkı _fossor_ ile karşılaştırıldığında _rostralis_ ile karşılaştırıldığında daha fazladır.

_T. t. macrotis_ (tip lokalitesinden örnekler) ile karşılaştırıldığında, _T. t. retrorsus_ rengi,
kuyruk uzunluğu ve diş sırası uzunluğu bakımından ayırt edilemez, ancak diğer tüm ölçümlerde ortalama olarak daha küçüktür.
Vücut uzunluğu,
baziler uzunluk, zigomatik genişlik, mastoidal genişlik veya nazal uzunluklarda örtüşme yoktur.
Temporal kasların sınırlarını belirleyen temporal sırtlar, eğimli değil düzdür ve daha düşüktür.
Timponik bullalar _T. t. retrorsus_'ta anterolateral olarak daha köşelidir.

_T. t. attenuatus_'tan kuzeye doğru, _T. t. retrorsus_ daha koyu (daha kahverengi) renk, sürekli daha uzun gövde, nispeten (kafatası uzunluğuna göre) daha kısa rostrum ve burunlar bakımından farklılık gösterir.
Son iki yapının doğrusal ölçümleri ve kuyruk uzunluğu iki alt türde yaklaşık olarak aynıdır ancak diğer tüm ölçümler _T. t. retrorsus_'ta ortalama olarak daha fazladır. Ayrıca, sonuncusunda temporal çizgiler orta kısımlarında dışa doğru eğilmek yerine yaklaşık olarak paraleldir ve
önden daha geniş bir şekilde arkada ayrılmak yerine.

_T. t. cheyennensis_'ten kuzeydoğuya doğru, _T. t. retrorsus_ biraz daha koyu (daha kahverengimsi) renk, sürekli
daha kısa gövde ve rostrum, genellikle daha dar V şeklinde
interpterygoid boşluk ve kafatasının daha küçük ortalama boyutları, özellikle mastoidal genişlik ve rostrum uzunluğu bakımından farklılık gösterir.

_Açıklamalar._--Miller'ın (Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:42, 14 Aralık 1930) 9 Kasım 1930'da "Elbert County'nin kuzeydoğusundaki Beaver Creek'in başının yakınında" alınan bir numuneden bahsetmesi, "8 mil. N.E. Agate, Elbert Co., Colo." olarak etiketlenen 2426 No'lu Colo. Mus. Nat. Hist. numunesine atıfta bulunur. Merhum E. R. Warren'ın koleksiyonunda bulunan Colorado Springs'ten gelen numuneler incelenmemiştir ancak Cary, Warren 1942 ve Bailey'nin (yukarıdaki eşanlamlılığa bakın) her birinin numuneleri daha koyu _fossor_ yerine _clusius_ olarak adlandırması, numuneleri geçici olarak _T. t. retrorsus_ olarak adlandırmak için bir temel oluşturur.

Denver Doğa Tarihi Müzesi'nin memeli koleksiyonlarından ve Amerika Birleşik Devletleri Ulusal Müzesi'ndeki Biyolojik Araştırmalar koleksiyonundan sorumlu kişilere, aşağıda listelenen materyali inceleme ve raporlama izni için minnettarlığımızı sunarız (incelenen örneklere bakın). Burada raporlanan çalışma, Deniz Araştırmaları Ofisi, Deniz Kuvvetleri Departmanı ve Kansas Üniversitesi (NR 161-791) arasındaki bir sözleşmeyle de desteklenmiştir. Temel karşılaştırmalı materyaller Kansas Üniversitesi Vakıf Derneği'nin yardımıyla elde edilmiştir. _Ölçümler._--Tip, bir erkek, ölçümlerini tip bölgesinden üç yetişkin dişinin (69835, 69839 ve 69838) ölçümleri takip eder. Toplam uzunluk, 216, 207, 210, 200;
kuyruk uzunluğu, 59, 58, 64, 56; arka ayak uzunluğu, 28, 28, 28,
26; kafatasının baziler uzunluğu, 32.8, 32.2, 32.3, 30.8; zigomatik
genişliği, 23.1, 22.5, ----, 20.5; en az interorbital genişlik,
6.0, 6.7, 6.2, 6.1; mastoidal genişlik, 18.2, 18.8, 17.7, 17. 7;
burun uzunluğu, 13.0, 13.7, 13.9, 14.0; kürsü genişliği,
7.6, 7.9, 7.4, 7.2; kürsü uzunluğu, 14.8, 15.6, 15.7, 16.0;
maksiller diş sırasının alveolar uzunluğu, 7.6, 7.2, 7.7, 7.6.

_İncelenen örnekler._--Toplam sayı, 13, hepsi Colorado'dan, şu şekilde: _Elbert County_ (Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist. [= Denver

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
